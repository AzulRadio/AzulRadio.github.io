youhy is a student. An engineering student. When he realized he need a place to put all the muffin in his head, he created this site.


This is a site for some short paragraphs, Chinese. <br>
Some Engi-Notes, English. Hopefully you can find some sparks among lines of his garage English. <br>
Some Visual Art. Could be good, could be bad, but they never carry any meaning.


And most importantly: All those things are mixed and won't be sorted or ranked by any mean. Because this site is not built for anyone. This is a garbage-bin for no man.


Thanks again for your attention.
